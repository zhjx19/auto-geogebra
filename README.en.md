<sub>Seven real examples: derivative definition · linear transform · sphere cross-section · button secant · regular n-gon → circle · Taylor approximation · coin-toss frequency. All exported by the official engine via `tools/ggb-export`; .ggb files live in examples/.</sub>

## Why this exists

You have a great teaching moment in mind — "let students drag a point and watch the secant become the tangent" — and you hand it to an agent. What comes back is GeoGebra command text that *looks* right: half of it errors on import, the slider starts at zero so two points coincide and nothing renders, and after export the buttons silently do nothing.

GeoGebra has 500+ commands and a set of traps that **only the real engine reveals**: lowercase names with coordinates become *vectors*, objects clashing with built-in functions (`sec`, `tan`) get silently renamed, degenerate initial values "succeed" while creating nothing, and script commands always return `false` even when they work.

This skill turns "teaching idea → classroom-ready .ggb" into a validated pipeline: clarify requirements first (no guessing), design an interaction-variable table, generate commands, pass **L1 syntax + L2 semantic dual validation**, then execute every command against the official engine in a local headless browser — verified per-command, exported with read-back checks. Fully local, zero API keys.

> The in-product documentation is Chinese (the target audience is Chinese university math teachers); commands, file formats, and repo structure are universal.

## Showcase

```text
"Teach the derivative as the limit of secant slopes — point B approaches point A, the secant approaches the tangent."
```

You get: ① a requirement-confirmation sheet; ② validated command code with a dual-validation summary; ③ a real-engine-exported `.ggb` + preview image.

![Derivative example](assets/demo1-derivative-definition.png)

<sub>Example 1 · Derivative definition: drag h from 2 → 0.01 and watch the secant approach the tangent.</sub>

![Regular polygon example](assets/demo5-polygon-circle.png)

<sub>Example 5 · Regular n-gon approaching the circle: slide n; play/stop/reset buttons included.</sub>

![Coin toss example](assets/demo7-coin-toss.png)

<sub>Example 7 · Coin-toss frequency: one-click re-toss; frequency stabilizes to 0.5.</sub>

## Quick Start

```bash
npx skills add zhjx19/auto-geogebra
```

- Static validation: Python 3.8+, **no third-party dependencies**;
- Real-engine export (optional): Node 18+ with local Chrome/Edge (engine loads from CDN on first run);
- **Zero API keys**; nothing is uploaded.

First prompt after install:

```text
Build a GeoGebra demo for "derivative as the limit of secant slopes" — point B approaches point A, the secant approaches the tangent.
It should be draggable, pass dual validation, and come back as a .ggb file.
```

## Triggers

- "Turn this topic into a GeoGebra interactive demo"
- "Make a draggable math courseware and export a .ggb"
- "Design the interaction variables / sliders for this demo"
- "Validate these GeoGebra commands for me"
- "This concept is too abstract — I want students to see the change"
- "Add a reset / re-toss button to the classroom demo"
- "Build small demos for these concepts, one each"

## How it's different

| Dimension | Raw agent output | GeoGebra MCP | auto-geogebra |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Command correctness | From model memory, often wrong | Depends on connected service | 500+ command index + L1 syntax + L2 semantic validation |
| Real-engine check | None | Yes (needs setup) | Built-in headless exporter: per-command verify + read-back + preview |
| Known traps | Discovered the hard way | — | Engine-tested rule base (vectors / reserved names / degenerate values / script silent failures) |
| Interactive buttons | None | Manual | `ggb_patch.py` injects onClick / onUpdate scripts |
| Teaching workflow | Generic | Generic | Requirement clarification + variable design + 28 university-math topic routes |
| Output | A blob of text | Execution result | Double-clickable .ggb + preview + validation summary |

## Safety boundaries

- **Does not replace the teacher's design**: the skill implements ideas; pedagogy stays yours;
- **Never fabricates artifacts**: without a browser/network it says so and delivers commands + instructions instead;
- **States the limits of static validation**: scripts, 3D, `Locus`, etc. are marked "must run to confirm";
- **No network upload**: validation and export are local (except the first engine CDN load);
- **Does not touch your files**: reads the material you give it, writes outputs to the path you choose.

## Verify & test

```bash
python scripts/smoke_test.py     # expect: 22 checks, 0 failures
```

CI runs the smoke test and both validators on **Windows and Ubuntu** for every push (see the Actions tab). When something errors or fails silently, check [references/anti-patterns.md](references/anti-patterns.md) first.
